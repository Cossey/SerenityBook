# Form Lookup Editor Cascading and Filtering

Both cascading and filtering can be applied to a Lookup Editor and can help reduce a drop down list to relevant items only.

Typically cascading and filtering are configured via Attributes on `Row.cs` files but you can access and change these properties in `Dialog.ts` files via the `this.form` object.
